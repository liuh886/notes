> **TL;DR**
> - **Problem:** Cluster-based CCUS needs trustworthy, auditable MRV and disclosure across multiple emitters, pipelines, and storage operators.
> - **Data:** Standards + policy requirements + project interfaces + monitoring telemetry (including emerging fiber/DAS-style sensing).
> - **Method:** Gap analysis (single-project MRV vs. cluster reality) + risk-boundary mapping + a tiered digital MRV & disclosure design.
> - **Output:** A practical dMRV blueprint: boundary definition, data fields, quality tiers, disclosure obligations, and governance touchpoints.
> - **Impact:** Higher trust for regulators/financiers and a clearer path to “bankable” CCUS cluster development.
> - **Links:** Slides and supporting materials available on request.

## What I did

This project focuses on **digital Monitoring, Reporting & Verification (dMRV)** for **CCUS clusters** (shared infrastructure and multi-party operations).

Key workstreams:
- Clarified why cluster CCUS breaks the “single-project MRV” assumptions (boundaries, responsibility, risk-sharing).
- Framed MRV as an infrastructure for **trust**: compliance evidence + financing signal, not just reporting.
- Designed a **tiered** digital disclosure model to translate engineering-quality data into governance/finance language.

## Current status

The research is ongoing. I can share slides and detailed materials privately.
