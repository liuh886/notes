### Situation
Geophysical data science sits at the intersection of complex physical theory and messy, real-world observations. Students often grasp the equations but struggle to translate them into robust code, facing barriers in data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, and reproducible modeling.

### Task
My objective was to bridge the gap between statistical theory and applied coding. I aimed to design a lab curriculum that didn't just teach "how to use a library," but **how to think like a data scientist**—handling uncertainty, validating models, and maintaining clean, version-controlled workflows.

### Action
*   **Curriculum Development:** Designed and deployed weekly Python labs covering the full data lifecycle:
    *   **Preprocessing:** Handling missing data and outliers in sensor time-series.
    *   **Modeling:** Implementing Linear/Multiple Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) from scratch and using libraries.
    *   **Advanced Analysis:** Stochastic processes and frequency domain analysis (FFT) for seismic and climatic data.
*   **Engineering Best Practices:** Introduced students to **Git/GitHub** for assignment submissions, enforcing version control habits early.
*   **Technical Mentorship:** Provided code reviews and debugging support for course projects, guiding students through feature engineering and model selection for their specific geophysical datasets.

### Result
*   **Reproducible Resource:** Created a structured, open-source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/liuh886/GEO4300_2023/) that serves as a permanent reference for future cohorts.
*   **Student Success:** Empowered students to successfully deliver independent research projects, moving from raw data to statistical inference with confidence.
*   **Bridge to Industry:** The workflows taught mirrored industry standards, preparing students for roles in energy and environmental analytics.

## Course Highlights

The course builds from statistical foundations to advanced machine learning applications in geoscience:

1.  **Statistical Foundations:** Probability distributions and hypothesis testing.
2.  **Linear Models:** Regression techniques and uncertainty quantification.
3.  **Multivariate Analysis:** Uncovering patterns with PCA and geostatistics.
4.  **Time Series:** Analyzing temporal dynamics in Earth systems.
