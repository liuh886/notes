## Screening good practive of time-lapse seismic

4D seismic, also known as time-lapse seismic, is a technique used in the oil and gas industry to monitor changes in a reservoir over time. By comparing seismic surveys taken at different times, geophysicists can identify changes in the subsurface that may indicate fluid movement, pressure changes, or other reservoir dynamics. This information is crucial for optimizing production strategies, enhancing recovery, and managing reservoirs more effectively.

I established a site to screen good practices of 4D seismic projects from published case studies.

The site is [here](https://liuh886.github.io/4d-seismic-hub).

## The site is still under development

To do list:

- [ ] Add more case studies
- [ ] Add more analysis of the case studies
- [ ] Add interactive visualization of the case studies
- [ ] Add a section for user contributions
- [ ] Improve the design and layout of the site
- [ ] Add references and further reading materials
- [ ] Add a section for frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- [ ] Add a section for contact information and feedback
