> **TL;DR**
> - **Problem:** High-quality 4D seismic know-how is scattered across papers/talks; teams repeat screening work.
> - **Method:** Curate + standardize summaries (what/why/how/so-what) pointing back to source.
> - **Impact:** Faster screening and onboarding for time-lapse program design.

## 4D Seismic Hub (time-lapse seismic + OBN)

4D Seismic Hub is a public, community-oriented knowledge product: it turns "great but scattered" time-lapse seismic experience into an easy-to-scan index of best practices and case studies, with short summaries pointing back to original sources.

It is designed for early-stage screening questions like:
- What has worked (and failed) for repeatability in a similar environment?
- When do PRM vs OBN vs streamer make sense?
- What attributes are actually decision-grade in the field context?
- What are the classic reference cases worth reading first?

## What's shipped

From the current build of the hub, you can find:
- **Resources** rendered from a maintained dataset (`_data/papers.yml`) so additions are lightweight and reviewable.
- **Case studies** in a consistent format (`_data/case_studies_map.yml`) to support pattern-matching across assets.
- **Working Group** docs (charter, cadence, contribution guidance) to make collaboration durable.
- **Citation + licensing** so the hub can be reused and referenced properly.

As of the current repo snapshot, the hub includes **14** curated resources and **15** case studies (and is designed to grow by contribution, not by one-off writing).
